## 📝 Notes (quick)
- If you want a **dynamic stats card** (contributions, language chart) that *won’t* hit public API limits, I can help you either:
  - **Deploy your own instance** of the stats generator (one-time setup on Vercel), or
  - **Use a GitHub Action** to periodically generate a static SVG and commit it to your repo (then the README loads it as a plain image).
- Tell me if you want either option and I’ll give exact steps and a ready-to-use action/template.
